        <h2 id="how-heading">How this site works</h2>
        <p>
          Living Words Today is a simple personal project that collects scriptures and
          quotes from modern prophets and apostles. The home page displays a featured
          quote, while the Quote Library page allows you to browse and filter the entire
          collection.
        </p>
        <p>
          As you explore, you’ll be able to filter quotes by topic and author and quickly
          find messages that match your current needs—whether you’re preparing a lesson,
          looking for a scripture to ponder, or just wanting a spiritual pick-me-up.
